**USER QUESTION:** {question}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - RELEVANCE ASSESSMENT:**
Before responding, analyze if the document context is semantically relevant to the user's question:

1. **HIGH RELEVANCE (Use document context)** - If the context contains information that directly or substantially relates to the question:
   - Provide a detailed, well-structured response using the document information
   - Use bullet points, bold formatting, and specific data from the context
   - Cite relevant facts, figures, and details from the documents

2. **LOW/NO RELEVANCE (Natural conversation)** - If the context is unrelated to the question (e.g., greeting, personal questions, technical documents):
   - Respond naturally as a helpful AI assistant WITHOUT forcing document content
   - Do NOT mention or analyze irrelevant document context
   - Engage in natural conversation appropriate to the question type
   - Keep responses concise and friendly

**RESPONSE FORMATTING (when using document context):**
- Use **bold** for important points and headings
- Use bullet points (•) or numbered lists for multiple items
- Include relevant numbers, percentages, or data points
- Structure longer responses with clear sections
